    <p>15Days Internship In RV Transformer Manufacturing in Davanagere <br> <br>
      A transformer is a device that is used to either raise or lower voltages and currents in an electrical circuit. In modern electrical distribution systems, transformers are used to boost voltage levels so as to decrease line losses during
      transmission.<br> <br>
      A distribution transformer or service transformer is a transformer that provides the final voltage transformation in the electric power distribution system, stepping down the voltage used in the distribution lines to the level used by the
      customer. </p>
